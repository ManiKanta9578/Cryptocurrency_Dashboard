<h1 align="center">Cryptocurrency Dashboard</h1>

A crypto dashboard is a digital platform that lives on a website or an app (either desktop or mobile). Its primary function is to track your cryptocurrency coins and monitor their historical prices and current values so that you can manage both your crypto assets and related financial plans accordingly. The dashboard integrates with cryptocurrency exchanges or trackers like CoinMarketCap through an API or other tool to update your crypto assets in real-time.

This is a cryptocurrency dashboard app built using **React 18**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React-redux**, **Redux-thunk**, **React-chartjs-2** and **Chart.js 3**. The app uses the **CoinGecko API** to get cryptocurrency data such as live prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, historical data, crypto categories, images, and more.
